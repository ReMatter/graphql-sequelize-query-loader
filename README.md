# GraphQl - Sequelize Query Mapper
This utility tool inspects the structure of a GraphQL Query and converts it to query parameters that Sequelize understands, to enforce eagerloading of associated resources. Essentially, it expects that all sequelize models have set on them, the appropriate associations to all related resources. Then, when given a graphql query, it produces ONE sequelize query object which includes ONLY the selected resources and for ONLY the specified attributes. This solves for the `N + 1` problem with database querying, as well as the problem of `over-fetching` of entity attributes in result sets.
